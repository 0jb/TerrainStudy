# TerrainStudy

What it currently does:
* Instantiates a map based on source textures. Basically textures are information of where to place indexed objects.
* Instantiated map is in a layering system, so it can instantiate multiple objects on top of each other to create complex structures.

TODO:

* Make alorigthm catch geometry, discard materials.
* Create seams, geometry between weldable vertices.
